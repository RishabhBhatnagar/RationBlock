Short Description:
Under Ration Distribution System(RDS), Indian government strives to distribute some basic essential commodities to a large number of people who are not capable of earning upto a certain threshold. People who are BPL are given commodities at a subsidised rate.
There is no criteria as to which families are above or below the poverty line. This ambiguity gives a massive scope for corruption and fallouts in PDS systems. ```[1]```. This ambiguity can be removed using a trust based system making use of blockchain system.

Description:
Indian Food Security System under Food and Public Distribution(FDS) spends 750billion rupees a year which is almost 1 percent of India's gross domestic product```[2]```. Out of 1.324 billion population, 46 million people lie below powerty line.
Considering simple mathematics,
```
46 million people => Rs.750 billion per year
         1 person => Rs.750 billion / 46 million per year
                  => Rs.16,304 per year
                  => Rs.47 per day
```
That is, for every single person in bpl, government spends approx Rs.47 per day. Since the Government fills the stocks in PDS in bulk, they get commodities in a very discounted rate. For instance, rice at Rs.2/kg and Rice at Rs.3/kg[4]. Hence, with Rs.27 per day, it should suffice the people below bpl[5], but still, there are people who have limited access to commodities of their rights.
This discrepancy in the system exists due to corrupt people who try to hoard stocks with them by using fake ration cards. According to the report by National Delhi Television Limited, there were 11 lakhs bogus ration cards because there are people holding more than one ration card due to which they get get to hoard the stocks which is meant for people bpl.
This amass causes
 - inflation for people in bpl and/or
 - lesser or no stock left for genuine victims.
